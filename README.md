# Bicycle Project Crowd Evaluation

This project aims to evaluate the quality and performance of a new crowd in identifying bicycles in images. The dataset consists of anonymized responses from annotators, as well as a reference dataset for comparison.

## Dataset 

The dataset includes two files: anonymized_project.json, which contains the annotator responses, and references.json, which contains the reference dataset. The responses include the task input, task output, and metadata about the vendor and annotator.

## Tasks 

The tasks for this project include gathering insights about the annotators, identifying trends in the data, analyzing the balance of the reference set, and identifying good and bad annotators.

## Running the code
To analyze and visualize the bicycle annotation dataset, you will need to download or clone this repository. Once you have done that, follow these instructions:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook named 'Bicycle_Annotators.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab or Visual Studio Code.

2. Run each cell in sequence to load the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and generate visualizations and statistics.

Note that you will need to have the following Python packages installed: pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
