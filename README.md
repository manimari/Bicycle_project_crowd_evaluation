# Bicycle Project Crowd Evaluation

This project aims to evaluate the quality and performance of a new crowd in identifying bicycles in images. The dataset consists of anonymized responses from annotators, as well as a reference dataset for comparison.

## Dataset 

The dataset includes two files: anonymized_project.json, which contains the annotator responses, and references.json, which contains the reference dataset. The responses include the task input, task output, and metadata about the vendor and annotator.

## Tasks 

The tasks for this project include gathering insights about the annotators, identifying trends in the data, analyzing the balance of the reference set, and identifying good and bad annotators.
